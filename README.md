# IAAS: An Application Unlocking Image Aesthetic Evaluation Expertise

The core of this study is the design of an Image Aesthetic Assessment System (IAAS), which integrates classic works of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), including Grad-Cam and Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold Networks (KAN), to achieve interpretability from image pixels to aesthetic attributes and values. Based on this interpretable capability, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are utilized to provide analysis, interpretation, and recommendations, leveraging their exceptional linguistic abilities derived from general knowledge. This system aids professionals in enhancing their aesthetic judgment and creativity. The study reports progress on the system's ability to assist non-professional photographers in understanding image aesthetics and boosting their creativity through several manual experiments.
